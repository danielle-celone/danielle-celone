## Hi! ðŸ¦Ž
I'm a master's student in computational linguistics at the University of Washington. I also have experience in lexicography and French-English translation. 
These days, I'm learning about:
- Syntactic parsing
- Decision rees
- Hugging Face transformers

Recently, I've learned about:
- Hidden Markov models/Viterbi algorithm
- Word embeddings
- The theory behind attention & transformer models

In the future, I'd like to learn more about:
- audio processing
- information retrieval (especially relationship extraction)
- NLP applications in environmental conservation

It helps me to keep tabs on what I've learned, so I'll be regularly updating [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qGlzCzM-QBGoyVGZ4Ba3ks-0LMk9MznQGT8e-xlIkaY/edit?tab=t.0) with new information :)
