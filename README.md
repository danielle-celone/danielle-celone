## Hi! ðŸ¦Ž
I'm a master's student in computational linguistics at the University of Washington. I also have experience in lexicography and French-English translation. 
These days, I'm learning about syntactic parsing, decision tree implementation, and Hugging Face transformers. In the future, I'd like to learn about audio processing, information retrieval and NLP applications in/crossover with environmental conservation.

It helps me to keep track of what I've learned, so I'll be regularly updating [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qGlzCzM-QBGoyVGZ4Ba3ks-0LMk9MznQGT8e-xlIkaY/edit?tab=t.0) with new information :)
